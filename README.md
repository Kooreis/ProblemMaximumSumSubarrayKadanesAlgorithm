# Question: How do you find the subarray with the maximum sum using Kadaneâ€™s algorithm? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript function `maxSubArraySum` uses Kadane's algorithm to find the subarray with the maximum sum in a given array. The function takes two parameters: an array `a` and its size `size`. It initializes two variables `max_so_far` and `curr_max` with the first element of the array. Then, it iterates over the array starting from the second element. For each element, it calculates the maximum of the current element and the sum of the current element and `curr_max`, and assigns this maximum to `curr_max`. It also updates `max_so_far` with the maximum of `max_so_far` and `curr_max`. After iterating over all elements, the function returns `max_so_far`, which is the maximum sum of a subarray in the given array. The main script creates an array `a`, calculates its length `n`, calls `maxSubArraySum` with `a` and `n` as arguments, and assigns the result to `max_sum`. Finally, it prints `max_sum` to the console, which is the maximum contiguous sum in the array.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is more object-oriented compared to the JavaScript version. It encapsulates the logic of finding the maximum subarray sum within a class, `MaxSubArray`. This class has a private property `array` that stores the input array, and a method `findMaxSubArray` that implements Kadane's algorithm.

The TypeScript version also uses type annotations, which is a feature not available in JavaScript. For example, the `array` property is annotated with the `number[]` type, and the `findMaxSubArray` method is annotated with the `number` return type. These type annotations help ensure type safety, which can prevent certain types of runtime errors.

The logic of Kadane's algorithm is slightly different between the two versions. In the JavaScript version, the algorithm keeps track of the current maximum sum (`curr_max`) and the maximum sum so far (`max_so_far`), and updates these values based on the current element of the array. In the TypeScript version, the algorithm keeps track of the maximum sum ending at the current position (`maxEndingHere`) and the maximum sum so far (`maxSoFar`), and updates these values based on the current element of the array. Despite these differences, both versions correctly implement Kadane's algorithm.

In terms of usage, the JavaScript version is a function that takes an array and its size as input, and returns the maximum subarray sum. The TypeScript version is a class that takes an array as input in its constructor, and has a method that returns the maximum subarray sum. This difference in usage can make the TypeScript version more flexible and easier to use in certain situations, such as when you need to find the maximum subarray sum for multiple arrays.

# C++ Differences

Both the JavaScript and C++ versions solve the problem using Kadane's algorithm, which is an efficient way to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in an array. The algorithm works by maintaining a running sum of the array elements, resetting the sum to zero whenever it becomes negative, and keeping track of the maximum sum seen so far.

The main differences between the two versions are due to the differences in the languages themselves:

1. Data Types: In JavaScript, there is no need to specify the data type of a variable, while in C++, the data type of each variable must be declared. For example, in the C++ version, `max_so_far` and `max_ending_here` are declared as integers.

2. Array vs Vector: In JavaScript, arrays are used to store the data, while in C++, vectors are used. Vectors in C++ are similar to arrays in JavaScript, but they are more flexible because they can dynamically resize.

3. Initialization of Variables: In the JavaScript version, `max_so_far` and `curr_max` are initialized with the first element of the array. In the C++ version, `max_so_far` is initialized with the smallest possible integer and `max_ending_here` is initialized with 0.

4. Looping: Both versions use a for loop to iterate over the array/vector, but the syntax is slightly different due to the language differences.

5. Maximum Value: In JavaScript, the `Math.max` function is used to find the maximum of two numbers. In C++, the `max` function is not used. Instead, if-conditions are used to check and update the maximum values.

6. Output: In JavaScript, `console.log` is used to print the output to the console. In C++, `std::cout` is used for the same purpose.
